# QApp Keystore

This project is designed to manage the keystore for signing Android applications. Below are the details on how to generate a new keystore and use it in your Android project.

## Files Overview

- **scripts/generate-keystore.sh**: A script that generates a new keystore file using the `keytool` command. It allows you to specify parameters such as alias, password, and validity.

- **keys/my-release-key.jks**: The Java KeyStore file that contains the private key and certificate used for signing Android applications. This file is generated by the `generate-keystore.sh` script.

- **key.properties**: Contains the properties for the keystore, including the path to the keystore file, store password, key alias, and key password. This file is referenced in the `build.gradle.kts` file for signing configurations.

- **build.gradle.kts**: The Kotlin DSL build configuration file for the Android application. It specifies project settings, dependencies, and signing configurations using the properties defined in `key.properties`.

## Generating a New Keystore

To generate a new keystore, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `qapp-keystore/scripts` directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   ./generate-keystore.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter the required information, such as the keystore password, key alias, and validity period.

Once the script completes, the new keystore file will be created in the `keys` directory.

## Using the Keystore

After generating the keystore, ensure that the `key.properties` file is updated with the correct path and credentials for the new keystore. This will allow the Android build process to sign your application using the generated keystore.

For more detailed instructions on configuring the `key.properties` file and using it in your Android project, refer to the comments in the `build.gradle.kts` file.
